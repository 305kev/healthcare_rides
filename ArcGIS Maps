Having run a feature importance analysis using linear regression and random forests in our EDA
file, we found that the EMS Calls per capita was most correlated with the following features: 
  (1) High Blood Pressure (Chronic disease)  
  (2) Diabetes (Chronic disease) 
  (3) Elderly Living Alone

We then mapped out these features as compared against EMS calls per capita: 
  (1) HBP: https://arcg.is/1D9jfW 
  (2) Diabetes Rates: https://arcg.is/49beC
  (3) Elderly Living Alone: https://arcg.is/109myj
